				<p>Some feedback from my wonderful clients!

				<p>"Jane is brilliant!!! I'm so glad that I found her while searching on the internet for a mobile hairdresser. Having Jane come to my home is convenient and easy. She does an excellent cut and colour for me and is always on the money with what I have asked for in a hairstyle. I look forward to my hair appointments as we always have a great chat. I have recommended Jane to my friends and family."<br />
				- Emma, Prahan</p>

				<p>"I found Jane through an advertisement in the Sunday Age and decided to make an appointment. As a mother of three small children, having a hair stylist come to your home was a very convenient option. I am extremely happy with the haircut that Jane gave me and I really appreciated that she listened to what I wanted for both me and my daughter. It is the best style I have had in years. I highly recommend 'Running with Scissors'."<br />
				- Terry, Canterbury</p>

				<p>"Thank you so much for being able to do my hair at such short notice last Monday and for doing my hair so beautifully. I had so many compliments and it helped me through a very difficult day."<br />
				- Liza.</p>

				<p>"With a love of quirky cuts and edgy colour, I can be a hairdresser's nightmare with how picky I am. Finding Jane was a match made in heaven! Her knowledge of cutting edge styles and products guarantees a salon-free experience you won't forget. Jane is willing to go where most hairdressers won't - she works with you to find the perfect cut and colour for you."<br />

				<h1>A bit about my business...</h1>
				
					<p>I am conscious of the impact that business has on the environment, from waste to energy and emissions. I am committed to making my small business as environmentally healthy as possible.</p>

					<h2>A few ways I'm helping:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>I wash my towels in cold water with biodegradable powder, and air dry them (yes, even in Melbourne's winter!)</li>
						<li>I reduce water usage to approximately the same or less than a 4 minute shower.</li>
						<li>I offset carbon emissions from my car (my biggest environmental impact). Visit <a href="http://www.carbonconscious.com.au/">Carbon Conscious</a> for information on how you can help.</li>
						<li>I use products that are kinder to your hair, body and the environment. There are less chemicals, they are not tested on animals, and the packaging is 100% recyclable.</li>
					</ul>
