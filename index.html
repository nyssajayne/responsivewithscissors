				<p>A great hairstyle can make you feel like a million dollars, and a fresh colour can really lift your entire image. Unfortunately these days almost everyone is time-poor and simply do not have the time to spend in a busy salon. If you work long hours, have young children, study and work, can't fit an appointment in your lunch break, or simply don't enjoy going to a salon, having a mobile hairdresser may just be the answer.</p>

				<p>Mobile hairdressing makes everything more convenient, from flexibility with hours, to having the whole family catered for in a matter of hours, no babysitters to organise and the freedom to relax in the comfort of your own home with a meal, a coffee or glass of wine. All this, without the salon price tag.</p>

				<p>Services for ladies, men and kids include cuts, colours/foils, blow-waves, styling, straightening, curls, up-do's, and makeup. Located in Brunswick, servicing surrounding suburbs and other Melbourne locations as required.</p>

				<p>I strive to be much more than "just a hairdresser", someone who can listen and understand what your individual needs are, be flexible and understanding of unusual situations and still provide a professional service. Please phone or email me for any information on ways I could help you and your family with general hairdressing, weddings or other special occasions.</p>
